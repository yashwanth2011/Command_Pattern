In previous Abstract factory pattern I created a factory which manufactures 
(where Mixing is one of the steps), Packs and Moves Sunblock units of different kinds
like Natural, Chemical and Oil.

In this project I'm preparing a remote control station to over see each function (mixing,
packing, moving) from a control console.

This remote control is used to operate various Machines like mixer, packer and mover. 
Where each machine is connected to a different slot but essentially have just 2 commands 
which are ON and OFF.

Using the RemoteControlStation we can operate these machines' commands.
